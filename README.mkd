# vim-pad

A quick notetaking plugin for vim.

It offers a similar way of managing notes to the one made popular by tools like
Notational Velocity, where file management is removed from the notetaking
workflow, being replaced by searching and sorting facilities, and where the creation
and searching of notes is integrated.

Notes in vim-pad are free-form; in fact it tries to make it easy to use any
format you want. It works great along other plugins like
[VimOutliner](https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner/) and
[quicktask](https://github.com/aaronbieber/quicktask).

**IMPORTANT**: `vim-pad` requires `+python` and `+conceal` support from vim.
Check if the flags are enabled in `:version`. Currently, it also requires
either a `grep` with perl regexes support or `ack`, which might not be the case
under OSX. Windows is not supported.
